## Template

If you want to use this project as a template, feel free. It installs gulp by default and its recommended that you use it to generate the files.

## Workflow

Execute the commands bellow inside dev-tools folder

```
npm install
```

```
npx gulp
```

**npx** is used instead of regular **npm** to force use local gulp avoiding global installation
